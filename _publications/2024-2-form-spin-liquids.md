We introduce a novel class of 3D spin liquids called 2-form U(1) spin liquids. These are described by emergent 2-form U(1) gauge fields, whose charged excitations are strings rather than particles. We introduce a classical Ising model on the pyrochlore lattice which realizes the classical version of this spin liquid and discuss how additional transverse exchange terms map perturbatively to a 2-form U(1) lattice gauge theory.
