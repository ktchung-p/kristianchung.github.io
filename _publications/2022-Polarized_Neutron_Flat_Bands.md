In this work we studied the use of polarized neutron scattering to expose the correlations of flat band modes in a frustrated magnet. In particular we explained the "flat NSF", i.e. the featureless non-spin-flip scattering cross section, of nearest-neighbor spin ice, and demonstrated how it attains features in dipolar spin ice.
