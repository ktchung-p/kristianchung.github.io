For half a century now there has been a rich ongoing debate as to whether Higgs and confined phases of gauge theories are the same or distinct phases. A famous 1980 proof by Fradkin and Shenker demonstrates they are thermodynamically the same bulk phase, but they remain separated by a first order line with a critical endpoint, very similar to the liquid-water phase boundary. In this analogy the Higgs phase is the liquid phase and the confined phase is the gas, and exhibiting phenomenologically distinct properties despite only being separated by a supercritical region. In this work we have studied through a combination of analytic arguments and numerical simulation the behavior of these phases with open boundary conditions, and demonstrated that the Higgs regime exhibits boundary symmetry breaking while the confined phase regime not. We show this to be a ubiquitous universal phenomenon, in Abelian gauge theory, non-Abelian gauge theory, and higher-form Abelian gauge theories.
